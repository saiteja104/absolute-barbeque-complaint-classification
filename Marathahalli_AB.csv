Chef Pandey Rakesh,a month ago,"The food was disappointing and lacked flavor; it didn't meet my expectations.
The meal was poorly prepared, and the ingredients seemed of low quality. The flavors were off, and the dish was not enjoyable at all. The food was cold and bland, and I found it inedible.
Now I will explain dish wise :
Bbq Grilled corn was marinated in ketchup. First time i I have seen grilled watermelon which is unhygienic. Pasta sauce all gravy food are ready made which is not good for health
