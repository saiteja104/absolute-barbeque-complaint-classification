Shalu Jain,5 years ago,Area wise this outlet is very small and not at all spacious . There were very less varieties. Overall experience was ok.
Sumit Raj,6 years ago,Not a good place for vegetarians. Good number of dishes for non veg guys. Good atmosphere. They celebrate birthdays and anniversaries as well to give you a special feel. One sad aspect is that they switch off the AC by 10:45pm while customers are still seated for their meals.

Shivendu Singh,6 years ago,They have a huge menu but taste-wise dishes are just average. Gets extremely crowded and without prior reservation you would be turned away even if you are a party of two.
