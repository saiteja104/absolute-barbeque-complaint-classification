In veg, a variety of starters were ditto, chilka cheeze aloo, grill paneer, mashroom etc and dinner items were just routine and some varieties of desserts

The worst part about the place is they were unable to manage the temperature. In this hot weather cooling was a big issue especially when it was crowded
