BT Wild Art,6 months ago,"2 stars, hardly found any difference from BBQ nation and this place. It seems to copy paste the original one. Food menu, ambiance everything is the same

The only difference was that it was a reasonable deal with drinks for large bookings.

In veg, a variety of starters were ditto, chilka cheeze aloo, grill paneer, mashroom etc and dinner items were just routine and some varieties of desserts

The worst part about the place is they were unable to manage the temperature. In this hot weather cooling was a big issue especially when it was crowded

Further, for drinks it was taking almost 20 min to make even if u order just 30 ml whisky and longer time of mix drinks. Reason being one or two people managing the counter for more than 100 people",,,
